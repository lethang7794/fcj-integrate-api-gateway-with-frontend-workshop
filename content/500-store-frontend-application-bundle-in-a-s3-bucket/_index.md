In this section, you'll learn how to prepare and deploy your frontend application to Amazon S3 for static website hosting. The process involves three main steps:

1. **Building the Frontend Application**: Compile your frontend code into production-ready static files using the build command.
2. **Creating an S3 Bucket**: Set up a new S3 bucket in AWS with the appropriate configuration for hosting a static website.
3. **Uploading Files to S3**: Upload your built frontend files to the S3 bucket.

By the end of this section, your frontend application will be stored in a S3 bucket on AWS, ready to be served over with the static website hosting feature of S3.
